# Architecture & Design Decisions

## Overview

The V60 Recipe Calculator is a single-file static web application (`index.html`) with zero external dependencies beyond a Google Fonts CDN link. It is designed to be opened on a phone while brewing coffee and deployed via GitHub Pages with no build step.

## File Structure

```
.
├── index.html                      # Entire application (HTML + inline CSS + inline JS)
├── .github/workflows/pages.yml     # GitHub Pages deployment workflow

└── LICENSE                         # License file
```

## Why a Single File?

Everything lives in one `index.html` with inline `<style>` and `<script>` blocks. This is intentional:

- **Zero build step** — no bundler, no npm, no framework. The file is the app.
- **Deploy and forget** — push to `main` and GitHub Pages serves it. No CI artifacts, no build cache, no dependency updates.
- **Instant load** — one HTTP request for the document, one for the font. No JS bundle to parse.
- **Portable** — can be opened directly from the filesystem (`file://`) for offline use.

## Application Sections

The page is divided into four visual sections, rendered top to bottom:

### 1. Header
Static branding with a link to James Hoffmann's original video.

### 2. Brew Steps (interactive)
A 4-step guided brew timer driven by a finite state machine (see below). Steps display recipe-specific values and countdown timers. This section is hidden until a recipe is selected from the table.

### 3. Ratio Slider
An `<input type="range">` (1:14 to 1:18, step 0.1) that recalculates the entire recipe table on every `input` event. Features:
- **Sticky default** — snaps to 1:16.7 when the thumb is within ±0.3 of the default value, making it easy to return to the standard ratio.
- **Reset button** — appears only when the slider is away from the default.

### 4. Recipe Table
A dynamically generated `<table>` with rows from 100g to 500g water in 10g increments. Columns: Water, Coffee (1 decimal), Bloom (2× coffee), Pour 1 (60% of water), Pour 2 (100% of water). The 250g row is permanently highlighted as the classic recipe. Clicking a row selects it and loads its values into the brew steps.

## Brew Step State Machine

Each of the 4 brew steps transitions through a strict sequential state machine:

```
locked → available → running → completed
```

| State       | Visual                          | Interaction              |
|-------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `locked`    | Dimmed, `cursor: not-allowed`   | None                     |
| `available` | Accent border, "▶ Tap to start" | Tap → starts countdown   |
| `running`   | Orange border, pulsing glow     | Tap → skip (early complete) |
| `completed` | Green background & border       | None                     |

**Rules:**
- Only step 1 starts as `available`; all others are `locked`.
- A step can only become `available` when the previous step is `completed`.
- Countdown timers auto-complete the step when they reach 0:00.
- Users may tap a running step to skip ahead early.
- The "Reset" button returns all steps to their initial state.

### Countdown Durations

Derived from James Hoffmann's timing structure:

| Step        | Duration | Rationale                               |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Bloom       | 0:45     | Pour bloom water, wait 45 seconds       |
| Pour 1      | 0:30     | Pour to 60% of total by 1:15 (45s+30s)  |
| Pour 2      | 0:30     | Pour to 100% of total by 1:45 (75s+30s) |
| Finish      | 1:45     | Swirl and drain, target ~3:30 total     |

## Styling & Theming

All styling uses CSS custom properties defined in `:root` for easy theming:

| Variable             | Value     | Usage                       |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `--espresso`         | `#3E2723` | Header background, headings |
| `--dark-brown`       | `#4E342E` | Header gradient end         |
| `--medium-brown`     | `#5D4037` | Hover states                |
| `--accent`           | `#8D6E63` | Borders, slider thumb, links|
| `--cream`            | `#EFEBE9` | Table header, step backgrounds |
| `--cream-light`      | `#FAF7F5` | Page background             |
| `--highlight-bg/border` | Orange tones | Default 250g row, running steps |
| `--selected-bg/border`  | Blue tones  | User-selected table row     |
| `--green-*`          | Green tones | Completed steps             |

Typography uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) via Google Fonts CDN, with a system font fallback stack.

## Responsive Design

- Max content width of 800px, centered.
- The brew steps grid uses `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr))` — 4 columns on desktop, 2 on mobile.
- The recipe table scrolls horizontally on narrow screens via `overflow-x: auto`.
- A `@media (max-width: 480px)` breakpoint reduces padding and font sizes.

## Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) deploys on every push to `main`:

1. Checkout the repository
2. Upload the entire root as a Pages artifact
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

No build command is needed — the static files are served as-is.

## Design Trade-offs

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single file over components | Simplicity; no module system needed for ~900 lines |
| Inline CSS/JS over separate files | One fewer HTTP request; easier to maintain as a unit |
| `setInterval` at 200ms over `requestAnimationFrame` | Sufficient precision for second-resolution countdowns; simpler code |
| 10g water increments | Captures the classic 250g recipe (missed with 20g increments) while keeping the table scannable |
| Sticky slider snap (±0.3) | Prevents frustration of trying to hit exactly 16.7 on a touch slider |
| Sequential step enforcement | Prevents user error during brewing — can't accidentally start pour 2 before pour 1 |
| Auto-complete on countdown zero | Hands-free brewing — user doesn't need to tap when timer expires |
